Maybe, for the induction in Zerlmelo, it is better to consider nodes of game tree as pairs of a history and a game world, and show the existance of a winning strategy among those that have played according to the history at that node, agains strategies that played according to the history at that node. The root with the empty history should then yield the actual winning strategy.
